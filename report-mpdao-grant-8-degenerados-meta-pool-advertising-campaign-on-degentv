We started the campaign in Sep3rd without the pitch, just showing the logo in our lives. We started to run the pitch in Sep 11th, so we decided to ran the campaign for one month more starting this date.

Also, we prefer to ran all the campaign and then provide the report with the results to close all the milestones together.

Disclaimers:

We did a partnership with Rafaelando YT channel, so we streamed for both channels. We included all the numbers.
Our youtube channel was removed in Oct 16th with no advice, warning or explanation. We tried to reactivate it but YT denied. We are starting over again.
